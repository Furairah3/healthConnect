# HealthConnect – Rural Telehealth Platform

## Project Overview
HealthConnect is a web-based telehealth platform designed to improve access to basic healthcare services for people living in rural and underserved communities. The system allows patients to submit health concerns online and receive medical guidance from trained healthcare volunteers and verified medical doctors without the need to travel long distances to hospitals or clinics.

The platform supports remote consultations, structured medical triage, health education, and case escalation within a secure and responsive web application. HealthConnect aims to reduce congestion in physical healthcare facilities while promoting early medical intervention and informed healthcare decisions.

## System Architecture
HealthConnect follows a **3-Tier Architecture**:

### 1. Presentation Layer (Frontend)
- HTML5  
- CSS3  
- Bootstrap 5  
- JavaScript  

Responsible for user interface, form validation, and responsive design.

### 2. Application Layer (Backend)
- PHP 8+
- PDO

Handles business logic, authentication, authorization, and CRUD operations.

### 3. Data Layer (Database)
- MySQL

Stores user records, health requests, activity logs, and verification data using relational constraints.

---

## Security Measures
- Password hashing using `password_hash()` (bcrypt)
- Prepared statements to prevent SQL injection
- CSRF token protection on all forms
- Session-based authentication
- File upload validation for doctor certificates
- Role-based permission checks
- Output escaping to prevent XSS attacks

---

## Terms of Service & Privacy Policy
- Users must explicitly agree to the Terms of Service and Privacy Policy during registration
- Mandatory checkbox with frontend and backend validation
- Policy content displayed via modal pop-ups
- Sensitive health data is restricted to authorized roles only

---

## Database
- MySQL database
- Relational structure with foreign keys and constraints
- SQL file included in the repository for setup and testing

---

## Testing
- **PHPUnit Testing:** Not implemented
